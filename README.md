# algorithm-practice

## Intro

This repository contains a set of algorithmic challenges, written in Typescript, that will help you improve your logical thinking and comprehension, as well as your ability to read and understand unit tests.

There are no instructions for what each algorithm needs to do, other than the name of the function and associated unit tests describing the desired behaviour.

## Instructions

### After cloning the repository:
- Run `npm i` to install
- Run `npm run build-watch` to start the typescript compiler
- In a second terminal window, run `npm run test` to test your code

### For each algorithm:
1. Remove the `throw` statement (that just indicates the work is not yet done)
2. Review the associated tests in `/src/__tests__/` to understand what is required of the algorithm
3. Remove `.skip` from the test so that the tests run (the first one is already removed)
4. Implement the algorithm yourself
